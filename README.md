# ECE 250 Test Case Repository
This respository is for storing test cases for projects in the ECE 250 course

# Contributing
To add test cases for a project, you will need to create a new branch and add your test cases to it. Once you have tested your test cases and are confident that they work, you will need to make a pull request to the main branch. After creating your pull request, you will need to get your pull request reviewed by another contributer. Once approved, your branch can be merged to main.
